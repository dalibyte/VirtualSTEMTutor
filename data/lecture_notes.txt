Physics Lecture Notes:

Lecture 1: Basics of Mechanics
- Mechanics is the branch of physics dealing with the motion of objects.
- Key concepts include velocity, acceleration, force, and mass.
- Newton's Laws of Motion are fundamental to understanding mechanics.

Lecture 2: Electromagnetism
- Electromagnetism is the study of electric and magnetic fields and their interactions.
- Coulomb's Law describes the force between two charged objects.
- Faraday's Law of Induction states that a changing magnetic field can induce an electric current.

Lecture 3: Thermodynamics
- Thermodynamics is the study of heat and energy transfer.
- The first law of thermodynamics is the law of energy conservation.
- The second law states that the entropy of an isolated system always increases.

Mathematics Lecture Notes:

Lecture 1: Functions and Graphs
- A function is a relation between a set of inputs and a set of permissible outputs.
- The graph of a function is a visual representation of the relation between variables.
- Common functions include linear, quadratic, and exponential functions.

Lecture 2: Limits and Continuity
- A limit is the value that a function approaches as the input approaches some value.
- Continuity means that small changes in the input result in small changes in the output.
- Limits are fundamental to the study of calculus.

Lecture 3: Differentiation
- Differentiation is the process of finding the derivative of a function.
- The derivative represents the rate of change of a function with respect to a variable.
- Common rules of differentiation include the power rule, product rule, and chain rule.
