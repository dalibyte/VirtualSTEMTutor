Physics Textbook Excerpts:

Chapter 1: Introduction to Physics
- Physics is the study of matter, energy, and the interactions between them.
- Important concepts include force, energy, mass, and charge.

Chapter 2: Newton's Laws of Motion
- Newton's First Law: An object in motion stays in motion unless acted upon by an external force.
- Newton's Second Law: Force equals mass times acceleration (F = ma).
- Newton's Third Law: For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.

Chapter 3: Work and Energy
- Work is done when a force applied to an object moves that object.
- Energy is the ability to do work. The two main types of energy are kinetic and potential energy.
- The law of conservation of energy states that energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed from one form to another.

Mathematics Textbook Excerpts:

Chapter 1: Algebraic Expressions
- An algebraic expression is a combination of variables, numbers, and at least one arithmetic operation.
- Examples: 2x + 3, 5y - 7, 4a + 2b.

Chapter 2: Quadratic Equations
- A quadratic equation is an equation of the form ax^2 + bx + c = 0.
- The solutions can be found using the quadratic formula: x = (-b ± √(b²-4ac)) / 2a.
- Quadratic equations can have two, one, or no real solutions.

Chapter 3: Calculus Basics
- Calculus is the mathematical study of continuous change.
- Differential calculus focuses on the concept of a derivative, representing the rate of change.
- Integral calculus deals with the concept of an integral, representing the accumulation of quantities.
